Finxerunt, Inc. is a growing international student-led non-profit organization founded on July 10th, 2017 on the basis of building a sustainable future, due to the several conceptual issues in current global systems in economics, education, healthcare, and equity among all people.

Finxerunt in Latin means to imagine and create. With its four principle research-based campaigns, the organization takes on tough global issues along with thousands of students globally through active civic engagement. The organization's peer-reviewed intense research is done at our laboratory network where students and experts work side-by-side to collect data to come up with the much needed courses of actions to create a sustainable future. Then after, Finxerunt develops campaigns and policies, while working with politicians and representatives to bring change to public policy globally. At the same time, the grassroots aspects creating a diverse community comes together around educating people on these researched issues through film-making, journalism, and social media.
